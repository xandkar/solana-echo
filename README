solana hello world
==================

An actually-minimal Solana program and client in Rust.

I'm learning Solana and all the examples, including the official hello-world,
are too complex to get the essential idea across.

I wanted a bare bones working example, entirely in Rust (not a JS/TS client),
but couldn't find one, so made this.


build
-----

    ./client-build.sh
    ./program-build.sh

run
---

1. Open 3 terminals: A, B and C
2. In terminal A, start the test validator:

    solana-test-validator

3. In terminal B, ensure you have ample sol to spare:

    solana airdrop 10 --url http://127.0.0.1:8899

4. In terminal B, watch the test validator logs:

    solana logs --url http://127.0.0.1:8899

4. In terminal C, deploy the program:

    ./program-deploy.sh

5. In terminal C:

    ./client-run.sh

6. Behold the output in terminals B and C!
